This involved performing clash detection, model validation, and verifying compliance with the established Level of Development (LOD) 3 standards.Additionally, I led the 3D printing process for the final physical model of the building. This included preparing the BIM model for export to ensure proper scaling and segmentation, ultimately supporting the project's goal of integrating digital design with physical prototyping.")
